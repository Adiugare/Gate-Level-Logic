# Gate-Level-Logic

Gate Level Logic is the fundamental representation of digital circuits using basic logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. It operates at the lowest level of abstraction in digital design, where circuits are built using interconnected gates to perform logical operations on binary inputs.

Key Aspects of Gate Level Logic:
- Basic Logic Gates – These gates process binary signals (0s and 1s) to produce logical outputs.
  
- Boolean Algebra – The operations performed by gates follow Boolean algebra principles.
  
- Hardware Description – Gate-level modeling is used in hardware description languages like Verilog to define circuit structures.
